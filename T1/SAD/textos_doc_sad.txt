##### Functional View #####

***** View Description *****

EN: The functional view is the easiest view for stakeholders to understand. This view defines the architectural elements that deliver the system's functionality. The goal is to specifie what is really architectural relevant, or in other words, what has a visible impact on stakeholders. As the rules says, our focus was to select, from the use cases given, the ones that were relevant for the system architectural and we agree that was important to refer the transformations, the calculations and finally, the import/export of a dataset to different type of files.

##### Context Diagram View #####

***** View Description *****

EN: A context diagram view is a high level view of a system and defines the boundary between the system, or part of it, and its environment, showing the 	 entities that interact with it. 
	In our diagram the user of the application is represented and it interacts with the "iStat", which means the application and the server. In turn, the server communicates with external libraries, agregated in the component named "Utilities".

##### High-level Module Decomposition & Uses View #####

***** View Description *****

EN: A high-level module decomposition & uses view its about partitionating the system into parts that are easier to conceive, understand, program and 
	maintain. Giving independence to the components, they can be simply replaced by others, keeping the system working.
	Our web application communicates with the server through http requests, and this one interacts with the dabase by jdbc requests. Finally, both application and server uses external API's to create graphs and import/export data files, respectively.

##### High-level C&C View #####

***** View Description *****

EN: A high-level C&C view enable us to see the system as a collection of runtime entities called components. During execution, the components need to 
	interact with others to support the system services. This interaction is provided by connectors.
	Our view is mainly composed by three components: the application "iStat.com", the server "iStat.com/api" and the database "iStatDB". The application interacts with the server by five different connectors, each one of them using a unique interface, but they all comunicate using http requests. Finally, the server communicates with the database using jdbc requests.

##### Module Layered #####

***** View Description *****

EN: A module layered diagram describes the architecture of the code, giving to us an overview of the components and also the relations and dependencies 	between them.
	Our sistem is mainly composed by three layers. The "iStat.com" layer knows the "iStat.com/api" layer, which agregates three segments. The first, named "iServices" contains the interfaces consumed by the services and he knows the "iBLL" segment. This one is responsible for the business logic and it knows the "iDAL" segment, where the data is going to be manipulated. Finally, this last one is connected to the "iStatDB" layer, responsible for the data persistence.

##### Deployment View #####

***** View Description *****

EN: A deployment diagram describes the system architecture in terms of hardware and its relationship with the different components (software).
	We have two main nodes, one of them is the user client application and the other is our Linux server. 
	The application runs in a browser, which can be any browser, and it communicates with our Linux server by http requests.
	Finally, our Linux server contains two components, an API based on Java and a MongoDB database.
